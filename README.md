# Bosta Technical Assessment

## Description:
1. Use our Bosta Shipment tracking GET request here (tracking number to be used: 6636234, 7234258, 9442984,1094442 )https://tracking.bosta.co/shipments/track/:trackingNumber
2. Create a react app that similar to our website tracking service (currently HTML on bosta.co)
3. Call the API and handle the response in a similar UI like the attached here
4. Build the UI completely responsive and use a UI assets similar to the ones inside these images
5. Data returned in the API is strings in english, please map it to Arabic with any way you think it will be better
6. Use font name: Cairo (search for it) and make the font weight adjustment similar to the shown below.

## To start Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### During Development
- Some limitations faced me during data mapping, some data were present in the given screenshots yet they were not available to me in the API, so every mising data field was handled with a placeholder.
- The router was made with convience to handle only Shipment Tracking Service.
- Every component was made responsive to be presentable on all devices.
